# AI Research Agent

## 📌 Description

This project is an early-stage prototype of **AI Research Agent** — a tool for exploring information in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**, and later also finding entry-level opportunities.

Currently, the app only provides a **frontend interface (HTML/JS)** that sends requests to a **backend (Python)**.
The backend for now just accepts these requests and returns **test responses**.

## 🚀 Roadmap

Planned functionality includes:

* 📰 Collecting and filtering important news and research papers.
* 📊 Highlighting trending topics and technologies.
* 💼 Searching and ranking job opportunities (with user ratings).
* ⚙️ Flexible user preferences for sources, filters, and output.
* 🤖 Integration with a local or hosted AI model for summarization and analysis.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript (static site)
* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask, SQLite for storage)
* **AI (planned)**: Local open-source models (Mistral, LLaMA) via Ollama
